# titanic_website
Website who consumes an API that predicts the probability of survival at the Titanic disaster based on machine learning. 

This Website take the user information by a very simple HTML formulary and send it to an API that returns the probability of the user survive at the Titanic disaster.
And display it into a HTML page.

You can find the API code here:

When running this into a local machine you need to run the API file first and then run the website in a different host (127.0.0.2 for example).
